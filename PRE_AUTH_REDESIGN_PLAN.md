# Pre-Authorization Management Module Redesign

## Implementation Plan Overview

This document outlines the complete redesign of the pre-authorization management module focusing on operational workflow management with improved tracking, compliance monitoring, and analytics.

## Core Requirements Analysis

### 1. Pre-Auth Tracking Features
- **Procedure Flagging System**: Automatic detection of procedures requiring pre-auth based on payer requirements
- **Auto-Population**: Generate pre-auth request forms with patient record data
- **Interactive Timeline**: Visual timeline showing days until procedure with color-coded urgency
- **Bulk Submissions**: Submit multiple pre-auth requests efficiently
- **Payer Criteria Library**: Quick reference cards for common procedures and payer requirements

### 2. Pre-Auth Dashboard Analytics
- **Status Tracker Grid**: Drill-down capabilities for pending/approved/denied/expired requests
- **3-Day Compliance Meter**: Percentage tracking of requests meeting deadline targets
- **Payer Response Analytics**: Trend visualization of response times by payer
- **Missing Documentation Alerts**: Direct links to required items with priority indicators

## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure (Days 1-2)

#### 1.1 Enhanced Data Models
```typescript
// Core entities needed:
- ProcedureFlagging: Auto-detection rules and payer requirement mapping
- PreAuthTimeline: Timeline tracking with urgency calculations
- ComplianceMetrics: 3-day deadline tracking and performance metrics
- PayerResponseAnalytics: Response time trends and performance data
- DocumentationAlerts: Missing document tracking with priority scoring
```

#### 1.2 API Endpoints
```typescript
// New API routes needed:
GET /api/pre-auth/flagged-procedures - Get procedures requiring auth
POST /api/pre-auth/bulk-submit - Submit multiple requests
GET /api/pre-auth/timeline/:patientId - Get timeline view
GET /api/pre-auth/compliance-metrics - Get 3-day compliance data
GET /api/pre-auth/payer-analytics - Get response time analytics
GET /api/pre-auth/missing-docs - Get documentation alerts
GET /api/pre-auth/payer-criteria/:procedureCode - Get quick reference
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Components (Days 3-4)

#### 2.1 Main Dashboard Layout
```typescript
// New component structure:
PreAuthDashboard/
├── StatusTrackerGrid/        // Pending/approved/denied/expired grid
├── ComplianceMeter/          // 3-day deadline compliance meter
├── PayerAnalytics/           // Response time trends visualization
├── DocumentationAlerts/      // Missing docs with direct links
└── TimelineView/             // Interactive procedure timeline
```

#### 2.2 Tracking Components
```typescript
ProcedureFlagging/
├── AutoDetectionEngine/      // Flag procedures needing auth
├── RequestFormGenerator/     // Auto-populate from patient records
├── BulkSubmissionInterface/  // Multi-procedure submission
└── PayerCriteriaLibrary/     // Quick reference cards
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Days 5-6)

#### 3.1 Interactive Timeline
- Color-coded urgency system (Green >5 days, Yellow 3-5 days, Red <3 days)
- Drag-and-drop timeline adjustments
- Milestone markers for submission deadlines
- Patient procedure clustering

#### 3.2 Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time compliance percentage tracking
- Payer response time heatmaps
- Trend analysis with historical data
- Performance benchmarking by department

#### 3.3 Alert System
- Priority-based documentation alerts
- Automated deadline reminders
- Escalation workflows for overdue items
- Integration with existing notification system

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Procedure Detection**: Scheduled procedures → Auto-flagging engine → Payer requirement lookup
2. **Timeline Management**: Flagged procedures → Timeline calculator → Urgency color coding
3. **Compliance Tracking**: Submission dates → 3-day deadline checker → Compliance metrics
4. **Analytics Pipeline**: Response data → Trend analysis → Visualization components

### UI/UX Design Principles
- **Color-Coded Urgency**: Consistent color scheme across all views
- **Drill-Down Capability**: Click-through navigation from summary to detail
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live data refresh for time-sensitive information
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient multi-item selection and processing

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache payer criteria and procedure requirements
- **Data Pagination**: Handle large datasets efficiently
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live status updates
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices
