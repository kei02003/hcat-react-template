Based on the Revenue Cycle dashboard screenshot and incorporating all three scenarios (#2 Denials, #4 Timely Filing/Appeals, and #5 Additional Documentation Requests), here's the comprehensive final prompt approach:
Initial Layout Prompt (Step 1)
"Create a healthcare revenue cycle dashboard layout with the following structure:
Header: Dark gray navigation bar at top with 'RevenueCycle' logo on left. Include 5 horizontal tabs: Summary, AR Management, Denials, Collections, Account Detail. Add a secondary tab row below for Denials sub-sections: 'Clinical Denials', 'Timely Filing', 'Documentation Requests', 'Appeals Management'. Add date range selector on far right showing '1/15/2022' to '12/31/2024'.
Left sidebar (20% width): Light gray background with 11 metric cards stacked vertically, focusing on denial, timely filing, and documentation KPIs.
Main content area (80% width): White background with flexible layout for different dashboard views.
Use a clean, professional design with subtle shadows on cards."
Comprehensive Metrics Panel (Step 2)
"In the left sidebar, add these specific metrics as cards covering all denial types:
1. Total AR: $912.79K with 'Avg: 399.46K (+128.51%)' below
2. AR Days: 44.7 with 'Avg: 40.4 (+10.73%)' below
3. Denied Dollars: $57.32K with 'Avg: $51.35K (+11.62%)' below - highlight in red
4. Documentation Requests: 342 with '2nd highest denial type' below - orange indicator
5. Redundant Doc Requests: 128 with '37% of total' below - red warning
6. Timely Filing at Risk: $142.5K with '47 claims' below - urgent red
7. Appeal Window Expiring: $38.2K with '15 claims <30 days' below - yellow
8. Auto-Detected Duplicates: 89 with '$67.8K recoverable' below - green
9. Clean Claim Rate: 88% with 'Target: 98%' below
10. Doc Request Response Time: 6.2 days with 'Target: <3 days' below
11. Payments: ($232.62K) with 'Avg: ($185.58K) (-25.35%)' below
Add color coding and icons to indicate status severity."
Documentation Request Analysis Dashboard (Step 3 - Primary View for Scenario #5)
"Create the Additional Documentation Request Dashboard with four main sections:

Intelligent Matching Engine:
* Split screen showing: Left side - 'Requested Documentation':
    * Payer's request details
    * Specific documents requested
    * Deadline for submission Right side - 'Already Submitted Documentation':
    * Original submission inventory
    * Date stamps and confirmation numbers
    * Percentage match score (0-100%)
    * Auto-generated response preview
Challenge Letter Generator:
* Template selector: 'Redundant Request Response'
* Auto-populated sections:
    * Original submission date and confirmation number
    * List of previously submitted documents
    * Reference numbers and timestamps
    * Applicable regulations citations
