Scenario #2 – Denials  
Objective 
Demonstrate how your platform supports physician advisors, preauthorization processes, denial management, 
and real-time documentation to maximize revenue cycle efficiency in a 500-bed acute care hospital. The primary 
goals are to: 
1. Streamline pre-authorizations to ensure completion at least 3 days prior to planned procedures. 
2. Automate denial reviews and challenge letters, targeting a 20% reduction in denials due to clinical 
necessity, DRG mismatches, or prior authorization issues within six months. 
3. Provide real-time documentation support to ensure accurate patient status and coding for maximum 
legitimate reimbursement. 
4. Achieve a 10% increase in clean claim rates and a 5% reduction in denial-related revenue losses. 
Scenario Background 
The hospital manages 20,000 inpatient admissions, 10,000 observation stays, and 15,000 elective procedures 
annually, with a payer mix of 40% Medicare, 30% Medicaid, and 30% commercial insurers. 2 
Current challenges include: 
1. Delays in pre-authorizations, with only 70% completed 3 days prior to procedures. 
2. A 12% denial rate for claims due to clinical necessity, DRG mismatches, or missing prior authorizations, 
costing $2 million annually in lost revenue. 
3. Inconsistent documentation leading to incorrect patient status (e.g., inpatient vs. observation), resulting in 
under-coding or denials. The hospital seeks to leverage technology to improve coordination between 
physician advisors and finance-driven processes, ensuring compliance with insurer criteria and optimizing 
reimbursement. 
Demonstrate Pre-Authorization 
1. Demonstrate how to flag a particular procedure as requiring pre-authorization, compare this against 
insurer’s criteria (e.g. BCBS’s medical necessity guidelines), and prepopulate a pre-authorization request 
form. 
2. Provide a dashboard which tracks pre-authorization status (e.g. pending, approved, denied) and 
completion times, showing 90% of requests completed at least 3 days prior for the sample cohort.

Demonstrate Denials 
1. Demonstrate how to screen a denied claim (e.g., for a heart failure admission denied due to “inappropriate 
inpatient status”) by analyzing the medical record for clinical indicators (e.g., vital signs, lab results, 
physician notes) against the insurer’s criteria. 
2. Demonstrate how to flag denials with a high likelihood of successful appeal (e.g. > 70% probability) and 
auto-generate a challenge letter citing specific chart elements (e.g., documentation of IV diuretics, 
hypoxia). 
3. Provide a dashboard which tracks denials summarizing lessons learned from valid denials (e.g., “missing 
documentation of medical necessity in 30% of cases”). 
4. Highlight metrics: Number of denial letters produced (target: 100% of unreasonable denials challenged 
within 5 days), and reduction in denials from clinical necessity/DRG/prior authorization issues (target: 20% 
reduction). 
5. Although integration with Epic is not expected, it might be helpful to diagram or demonstrate how API 
integration would be a part of an overall workflow. 
Demonstrate Documentation Support for Coding & Reimbursement 
1. Show how the platform monitors patient status in real-time and compares clinical data against insurer-
specific criteria (e.g., payer-specific guidelines) to recommend status changes. 
2. Demonstrate alerts at key milestones, such as 24 hours post-admission or upon discharge order, notifying 
clinicians if documentation supports a different status (e.g., upgrading from observation to inpatient for a 
heart failure patient based on extended IV therapy). 
3. Provide a dashboard showing real-time patient status accuracy (e.g., 95% alignment with insurer criteria) 
and coding capture (e.g., CC/MCC capture rate increase by 10% for the cohort
